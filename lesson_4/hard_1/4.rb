The designers of the vehicle management system now want to make an adjustment
for how the range of vehicles is calculated. For the seaborne vehicles, due to
prevailing ocean currents, they want to add an additional 10km of range even
if the vehicle is out of fuel.

Alter the code related to vehicles so that the range for autos and motorcycles
is still calculated as before, but for catamarans and motorboats, the range
method will return an additional 10km.

It didn't occur to me to use super here!
I just rewrote the method, that could certainly be a bit DRYer.
